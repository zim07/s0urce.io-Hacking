# Scripts

## Auto hack people
 - The script contained in `s0urce.io - attempt<x>.js` will automatically "type" commands to hack people for you.
 - Note that it will not automatically choose a target for you, it isnt fully automated and requires to still have human input.
 - copy the contents of the file into your clipboard.
 - open the website (s0urce.io) in your browser.
 - Press F12 to open the development console. (Works in both chromium and firefox based browsers.)
 - Paste the code into the console and press enter to execute it.
 - The words needed to hack people will automatically be typed if the script has seen that word before. (It will most likely fail because of cycling the list.)
 - If the bot doesn't do anything, just help it by typing words, eventually the bot will take over once you've taught it enough words.

## Export your bot's memory and load it again
 - Type `exportBrain()` without quotes into the console to save your bot's current memory.
 - It will give you a command to run next time after loading the script to reload your bot's memory.
 - Please keep in mind, the word file is cycled a lot, which means your bot may need to be taught again if you come back after a long time.
